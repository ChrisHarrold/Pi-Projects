# Pi-Projects
Code related to My IoT projects and blog series

Current Files:

led.py - python for blinking an LED with Raspberry pi

led2.py - same as above but with two lights

sound.py - sound sensor detector code

sound_svc.py - runs the detection as a service in fully auto loop mode

level.html - google guage HTML page for displaying the output of the detector (copy to /var/www/html on the Pi)

I have put many comments into the code itself and will update here as well.
